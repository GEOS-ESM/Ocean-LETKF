I realized that sending many jobs through the workflow manager (rocoto) caused a lot of wait time. By sending more
intensive jobs, but fewer of them, the total wallclock time seems to be improved. The 'compact' versions of the scripts
are identical functionally but have this organization.

The 'hybrid_robs' version is the current main script for using real data.

run.xml.rocoto.g4p1_robs    => godas with real obs  
run.xml.rocoto.hybrid       => hybrid with synthetic obs  
run.xml.rocoto.hybrid_robs  => hybrid with real obs  
run.xml.rocoto.hybrid_tsa   => hybrid with real profile and altimetry obs  
run.xml.rocoto.letkf        => letkf with synthetic obs
