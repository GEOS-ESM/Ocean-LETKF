# Start by preparing the forecast and observation datasets for this analysis
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Prepare the appropriate source and destination directories and run restart file setup script
cd FCST/
sh setup_fcst_DI.sh  # (for example; set up a new script for a new data source)

# Prepare the appropriate source and destination directories and run obs setup script
cd OBS/
sh setup_obs_DI.sh  # (for example)

# Prepare the static data (i.e. the grid specification file)
cd STATIC/
# copy the mesh_mask.nc nemo grid specification file here
# see README to reduce the size of the file, if desired

# Assiming the Ocean-LETKF and the obs operator have been built 
# (in Ocean-LETKF via github: https://github.com/UMD-AOSC/Ocean-LETKF )
# Either:
cd RUN/              # to run up to a 4-member ensemble at 1/4-degree or any size ensemble at lower resolution
# or:
cd RUN_SUBGRIDS/     # tp run > 4-member ensemble at 1/4-degree resolution or higher

# From there, follow directions in the README files for each subdirectory
