# Instructions for this directory:
# This code is designed to set up and run the Ocean-LETKF for NEMO subgrids

# Set up the global parameters that will populate all RUN/*.sh scripts:
vim params.sh
# Set up the background files in the working directory:
sh setup_bgfiles.sh
# Preprocess the NEMO observation feedback files:
# OPTIONS:
# 1) if obs do not have perturbed locations, you can just run without qc
#    (set GLOBAL_DO_QC=0 in params.sh) and input the fdbkqc file
# 2) If obs have perturbed locations, then you can run with qc:
#    (set GLOBAL_DO_QC=1 in params.sh), input the fdbk files and
#    supply a fdbkqc control file as a 'mask' for what obs to keep
# 3) Run with qc turned off entirely:
#    (set GLOBAL_DO_QC=0 in params.sh) and input the fdbk files instead of fdbkqc
sh preprocess_obs.sh
# Compute the observation operator to change NEMOVAR netcdf to LETKF binary input format
sh setup_obsop.sh
# Link obs to the subgrid working directories
sh link_obsop.sh
# Set up the grid specification file for a subgrid (and flag if it contains no ocean data)
sh setup_grid.sh
# Run the main letkf analysis on all subgrids:
qsub run_subgrids.sh
# -or- to run only 1 subgrid at a time:
qsub run_one.sh 
# Compute ensemble mean and standard deviation post-analysis:
sh postprocess_one.sh  # For one subgrid
