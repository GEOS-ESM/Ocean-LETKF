These are sample setup files used to prepare a single anaylsis at ECMWF
using the NEMOVAR 'feedback' files that contained observations and 
model equivalents at the observation locations.

cd OBS/
sh setup_obs.sh

cd FCST/
sh setup_fcst.sh

cd RUN/
sh setup_bgfiles.sh
sh preprocess_obs.sh
sh setup_obsop.sh
qsub run.sh
