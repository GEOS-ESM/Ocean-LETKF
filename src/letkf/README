To build:  
(the first time:)  
update the config files for your machine. E.g. config files currently exist for GAEA and DT2.  
(every time:)  
update the config/machine.sh file to specifiy "machine=<YOUR MACHINE NAME>"  
At the command line, run "sh make_letkf.sh"  


# STEVE:  
The code has been reogranized to put static PARAMETERS and namelist controllable parameters  
in params_XYZ.f90 files, while SAVE variables and other reused variables are in vars_XYZ.f90 files.  

Notably, the ensemble size 'nbv' has been placed in the params_letkf.f90 file.  
nbv is now adjustable via namelist file input.nml

I am currently transitioning from Gaea to "Gaea3". There is some duplication due to that change.

# Dynamic versus static arrays:
vars_model.f90 and params_model.f90 can either be linked from the "".static version or the "".dynamic version.
On Gaea, the dynamic version takes about 50% longer than the static. However, the dynamic version
allows one to specify the model dimension at runtime and was desired by some users.

The hit going from static to dynamic for the ensemble size was only a few seconds, so for now we're
keeping the dynamic version for that parameter so that ensemble size can be specified at runtime.
