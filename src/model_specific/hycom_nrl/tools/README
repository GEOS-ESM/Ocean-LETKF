# Test routines for reading and writing NCODA bindary data:


1) test_io_subgrid.f90
This compiles when building letkf. It will sample calls to read_restart and write_restart.
Using the ncoda namelists oanl and gridnl and the LETKF namelist input.nml, a small 
subgrid will be updated by adding 1 to the value of the input file only within the small local patch.

setup and run with: iotest.sh

2) test_read_bin.f90
This program simply reads the binary ncoda data and prints a few values and max/min.
