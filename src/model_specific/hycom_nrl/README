# NCODA-HYCOM model I/O, parameters, etc.

This directory contains files specific to the NCODA-HYCOM build of the Ocean-LETKF system.

common_debug_hycom_nrl.f90  :: routines supporting general debugging throughout the letkf main code
common_mpi_hycom_nrl.f90    :: mpi support routines for this model setup (can potentially be generalized across models)
hycom_nrl_io.f90            :: I/O routines specific to hycom (should be replaced with identically-named routines that read hycom ab-format)
vars_model.f90              :: variables used by this model, often sourced throughout the code
common_hycom_nrl.f90        :: the main reading and writing routines for restart or diagnostic model files
common_obs_hycom_nrl.f90    :: the main reading and writing routines for observation data and interpolating from model grid to obs locations
params_model.f90            :: fixed parameters and input parameters for the model
