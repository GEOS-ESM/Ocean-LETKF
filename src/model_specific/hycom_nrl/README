# HYCOM model I/O, parameters, etc.

This directory contains files specific to the HYCOM build of the Ocean-LETKF system.

blkdat.input                :: a sample input file for testing
common_mpi_hycom.f90        :: mpi support routines for this model setup (can potentially be generalized across models)
hycom_io.f90                :: I/O routines specific to hycom (should be replaced with identically-named routines that read hycom ab-format)
vars_model.f90              :: variables used by this model, often sourced throughout the code
common_hycom.f90            :: the main reading and writing routines for restart or diagnostic model files
common_obs_hycom.f90        :: the main reading and writing routines for observation data and interpolating from model grid to obs locations
params_model.f90            :: fixed parameters and input parameters for the model
test_io.f90                 :: code to test the i/o routines
