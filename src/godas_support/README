These are support routines, written in C by David Behringer,
for the processing of obs and background error covariance
for NCEP's 3DVar-based GODAS.


I am gradually phasing out the need for these preprocessing files for use with LETKF.
The PTMP_SAL routines to read in netcdf obs and add obs error estimates are now in
the independent obs oeprators in the obs/ directory, written fully in fortran.

The PREP_ALT and PREP_SBC are being replaced by independent obs operators as well.
