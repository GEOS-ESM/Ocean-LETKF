(the first time:)  
update the config files for your machine. E.g. config files currently exist for GAEA and DT2.  
(every time:)  
update the config/machine.sh file to specifiy "machine=<YOUR MACHINE NAME>"  
At the command line, run "sh make_letkf.sh"  


# STEVE:  
The code has been reogranized to put static PARAMETERS and namelist controllable parameters  
in params_XYZ.f90 files, while SAVE variables and other reused variables are in vars_XYZ.f90 files.  

Notably, the ensemble size 'nbv' has been placed in the params_letkf.f90 file.
